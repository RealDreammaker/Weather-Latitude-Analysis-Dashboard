# Web Visualization Dashboard
##[Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude](https://realdreammaker.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/)

### Background

The challenge is to plot [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

### Requirements

The website must contain:
* A landing page
* Four visualization pages
* A "Comparisons" page 
* A "Data" page 

At the top of every page, there must be a navigation menu that:
* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section (notice the background color change).

### Result
Finally, the website was deployed to [GitHub pages](https://realdreammaker.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/).
